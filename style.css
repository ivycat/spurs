Description: Spurs combines Holger Koenemann's UnderStrap theme with a page wrapper and some other dev utilities.

Spurs is based on UnderStrap, which combines the Underscores (_s) theme with Bootstrap 4.
Like UnderStrap, Spurs is a solid starting point for a WordPress theme project that includes build tools to make
development faster and easier.

While you can use Spurs as a child theme, it's meant to be a parent or the basis of your new, amazing creation.

Includes Font Awesome support, Contact Form 7 support, built-in widget slider, and more helpful stuff.

IMPORTANT: All developer dependencies are not bundled with this install file. Just download the .zip, extract it and run
"npm install" and "gulp copy-assets" inside the extracted /spurs folder.
That downloads everything and moves it in place so that you can recompile your CSS and JS files;

This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
