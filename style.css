Description: Spurs combines Holger Koenemann's UnderStrap theme with a page wrapper and some other dev utilities.

UnderStrap is a combination of Automattic´s _s theme and Bootstrap 4.
Made as a solid starting point for your next theme project and WordPress website.
Use it as starter theme or as a parent theme. It is up to you.
Including Font Awesome support, built-in widget slider and much more you need for basic websites.

IMPORTANT: All developer dependencies are not bundled with this install file. Just download the .zip, extract it and run
"npm install" and "gulp copy-assets" inside the extracted /understrap folder.
That downloads everything and moves it in place so that you can recompile your CSS and JS files;

A developer version (with Gulp/node and Sass sources) is available on gitHub: spurshttps://github.com/sewmyheadon/spurs
Version: 0.6.11
